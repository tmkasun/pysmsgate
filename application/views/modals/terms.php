            Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”).<br>

            permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or<br>
            stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are<br>
            investigating suspected misconduct.<br>
            <br>
            Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.<br>
